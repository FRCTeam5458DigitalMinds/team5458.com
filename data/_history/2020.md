During the beginning of the 2020 season, Team 5458 members took on increased leadership roles within the individual subteams, and achieved tremendous growth in training members in building, designing, and programming. Though the COVID-19 pandemic sadly interrupted a season we hoped would bring us great success, our team has found ways to give back to our community. Using 3-D Printers, our team partnered with Square One, the makerspace at the Woodland Public Library, to produce face shields for frontline workers, who are fighting endlessly against COVID-19 (Pictures under the Images tab).
