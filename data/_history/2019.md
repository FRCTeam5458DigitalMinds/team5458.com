The 2019 season showed our team making huge strides. Robot wise, it was our first year with an elevator, which greatly increased our scoring capabilities. At the Central Valley Regional, we ranked 16th out of 49 teams and were selected for the 5th alliance, allowing us to finish as quarterfinalists. Though we didn't do as well at the Sacramento Regional, we were still selected for the 6th seeded alliance, and finished our competition season off as quarterfinalists. We also participated in more offseason competitions, including Capital City Classic and MadTown Throwdown. At Capital City Classic, we were chosen for the 2nd seeded alliance for the second year in a row, and came home as 2nd place finalists. In our first experience at MadTown Throwdown, we were selected for the 3rd seeded alliance. In a heated round of finals matches, we left as 2nd place finalists among some of the best teams in the world. As far as outreach, we further developed our summer camps with a new Intermediate session where students who were capable of the fundamentals could progress through more difficult challenges, and built community teams and clubs at elementary and middle schools to expose more students to opportunities in STEM.
