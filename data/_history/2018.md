In 2018, our team ranked 9th out of 48 teams at the Central Valley Regional in Fresno. We made it to quarterfinals and were picked to be on the 3rd ranked alliance. Although we didn't perform as well at the Sacramento Regional, it was enough to qualify us for the 2018 World Championships in Houston, TX. We were selected by the 4th seeded alliance in our division, and finished as quarterfinalists, a huge accomplishment for our team. In our offseason competition that fall, Capital City Classic, we continued to surpass our expectations, finishing as finalists as part of the alliance headed by our mother team, Team 1678 Citrus Circuits. This season was also our first year hosting a Youth Robotics Summer Camp for students in grades 4-8 where students learned to work collaboratively on project-based challenges using VEX Robotics kits.
