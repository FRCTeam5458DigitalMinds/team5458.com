title: FRC At Home
year: 2021
---

Despite not being able to attend competitions, meet in person during the season (January-April), or build a robot this year, team 5458 made the most of these unique
circumstances and the at-home challenges. FIRST developed three challenges for the 2021 season; the Infinite Recharge at Home challenge, where our team used CAD
to design a robot for the 2020 game, the Game Design challenge, where teams came up with an original game that could be played in an FRC season (including a handbook,
rules video, and an outline of how scoring would work), and the Innovation Challenge, where teams designed an innovation to improve physical and mental wellness through active
movement. As a team, we separated into each of these three groups. Our Innovation and Game Design Challenge groups interviewed with FRC judges, and our Innovation Challenge team
was designated as a semifinalist! As a semifinalist, our team had the opportunity to apply to be a Qualcomm Innovation Ambassador, which we were selected for. As an ambassador,
the Innovation challenge team will share their experience designing/innovating and encourage more people to explore innovation.
