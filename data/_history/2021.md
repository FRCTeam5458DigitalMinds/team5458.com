title: FRC At Home
year: 2021
---

Despite not being able to attend competitions, meet in person during the season (January-April), and not building a robot this year, team 5458 made the most of these unique
circumstances and made the most of the at-home challenges. FIRST developed three challenges for the 2021 season; the Infinite Recharge at Home challenge, where our team used CAD
to design a robot for last year's challenge, the Game Design challenge, where teams came up with an original game that could be played in an FRC season (including a handbook,
rules video, and an outline of how scoring would look), and the Innovation Challenge, where teams designed an innovation to improve physical and mental wellness through active
movement. As a team, we separated into each of these three groups. Our Innovation and Game Design Challenge groups interviewed with FRC judges, and our Innovation Challenge team
was designated as a semifinalist! As a semifinalist, our team had the opportunity to apply to be a Qualcomm Innovation Ambassador, which we were selected for. As an ambassador,
the Innovation challenge team will share their experience with innovation and design and encourage more people to explore STEM and innovation.
