In 2017, our team ranked 12th out of 56 teams at the Sacramento Competition. We made it onto quarterfinals and had the opportunity to be alliance captains. At the Las Vegas Regional, we placed 9th out of 49 teams and were alliance captains once again. We were up against top tier teams â€“ one of which is mentored by NASA. Unfortunately, our team did not advance to finals, but we made noteworthy accomplishments nonetheless. For example, we managed to achieve a spot at the 2017 World Championships in Houston, TX, and finished in 2nd place out of 67 teams in our division.
