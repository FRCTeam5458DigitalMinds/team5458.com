On October 23, Team 5458 began its fall Design Challenge using the VEX Robotics Competition game, Starstruck. The team is split up into six groups to design, build, 
and program a robot to play the game, while simultaneously being trained on the engineering design process leading into the 2022 build season.
We will hold a competition on December 4th to conclude our Design Challenge.
