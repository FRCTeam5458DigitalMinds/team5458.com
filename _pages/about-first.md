FIRST (*F*or *I*nspiration and *R*ecognition of *S*cience and *T*echnology) was founded in 1989 to inspire young people’s interest and participation in science and technology. FIRST Championships are held annually to promote and inspire K-12 students to engage in innovative processes and STEM activities.

>“To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.” 

Dean Kamen, Founder

At the beginning of each year, FIRST specifies the tasks that the robots need to perform in the competition. Throughout the 6-week build season, students collaborate on designing, building, and programing a robot in order to compete in regional tournaments to ultimately qualify for world championships. This building process requires active cooperation among members and establishes intrapersonal skills, such as integrity, self-confidence, and leadership
