Founded August 26, 2014, Team 5458 has built an amazing history over its 4 years.

## Previous Competitions:

### 2015: Recycle Rush

On March 21, 2015, Team 5458 won finals and the Rookie All-Star Award at the Sacramento Regional in UC Davis. The award recognized us for being a first year team and our dedication to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. This double qualified us for the FIRST World Championship in St. Louis, Missouri, a rare opportunity that only 600 out of over 3,000 FRC teams were able to experience.

### 2016: Stronghold

During the 2016 build season, at the Sacramento Regional, Digital Minds ranked 36th, out of 60 teams, and proceeded to rise as high as the 11th rank before the end of the competition– finishing in the top third of the field.

### 2017: Steamworks

In 2017, our team ranked 12th out of 56 teams at the Sacramento Competition. We made it onto quarterfinals and had the opportunity to be alliance captains. At the Las Vegas Regional, we placed 9th out of 49 teams and were alliance captains once again. We were up against top tier teams – one of which is mentored by NASA. Unfortunately, our team did not advance to finals, but we made noteworthy accomplishments nonetheless. For example, we managed to achieve a spot at the 2017 World Championships in Houston, TX, and finished in 2nd place out of 67 teams in our division.
