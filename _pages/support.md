Team 5458 is a robotics team based in Woodland, CA. Digital Minds introduces students to the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Students build leadership and communication skills while working with fellow students. We open for pathways for students to succeed in both STEM and business fields by using real hands-on experience alongside professionals. Team 5458 is an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome.

In 2018, Digital Minds strived to expand outreach within the Woodland community with goals of inspiring younger students to engage in STEM activties. Digital Minds offers a Robotics Summer Camp for students, grades 4-8. The week-long camp takes students through a project-based challenge, in which students learn how to design, build and program a robot. The program features a fun and interactive competition with peers where students have the opportunity to put their creations to the test. Through the experience, students developed skills such as communication, patience, teamwork, and interacting with others.
