## About 5458
Team 5458 is a robotics team based in Woodland, CA. Digital Minds introduces students to the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Students build leadership and communication skills while working with fellow students. We open for pathways for students to succeed in both STEM and business fields by using real hands-on experience alongside professionals. Team 5458 is an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome.

In 2018, Digital Minds strived to expand outreach within the Woodland community with goals of inspiring younger students to engage in STEM activties. Digital Minds offers a Robotics Summer Camp for students, grades 4-8. The week-long camp takes students through a project-based challenge, in which students learn how to design, build and program a robot. The program features a fun and interactive competition with peers where students have the opportunity to put their creations to the test. We have expanded to also offer an
intermediate camp to best serve students with varying levels of experience.

## About FIRST
FIRST (*F*or *I*nspiration and *R*ecognition of *S*cience and *T*echnology) was founded in 1989 to inspire young people’s interest and participation in science and technology. FIRST Championships are held annually to promote and inspire K-12 students to engage in innovative processes and STEM activities.

>“To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.” 
Dean Kamen, Founder

At the beginning of each year, FIRST specifies the tasks that the robots need to perform in the competition. Throughout the 6-week build season, students collaborate on designing, building, and programing a robot in order to compete in regional tournaments to ultimately qualify for world championships. This building process requires active cooperation among members and establishes intrapersonal skills, such as integrity, self-confidence, and leadership.
