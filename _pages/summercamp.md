## 2021 Digital Minds Summer Camps

### Session 1 (Introductory Camp): June 21-25
### Session 2 (Introductory Camp): June 28-July 2
### Session 3 (Intermediate Camp): July 5-9

### Health & Safety protocols that will be in place during the camps:
- All participants and staff will be required to properly wear face masks at all times.
- Participants will work individually to build their robots. There will be exceptions to this. Parents/Guardians can request that their child be paired with a specific partner, such as a sibling. 
- Participant work stations will be separated around the room at least 3 feet apart per current CDC classroom guidelines.
- The staff and participants will be required to wash their hands (or use hand sanitizer) upon entering or re-entering the room. Hand sanitizer stations are located at the 2 classroom entrances, plus there are multiple sinks with soap dispensers in the room.  
- There is a registration cap to enable social distancing within the classroom.
