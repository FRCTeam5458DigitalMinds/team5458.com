### Every summer, Digital Minds holds robotics summer camps to give students entering grades 4-8 hands-on experience in STEM through project-based challenges with their peers. We hold introductory and intermediate sessions to cater to students with different levels of experience.

## **Introductory Robotics Camps:**
### Session 1: June 22-26, 9 AM - 3 PM
### Session 2: July 6-10, 9 AM - 3 PM
### Cost: $250
### In this camp, students develop science, math, engineering and programming skills while designing, building, and programming a robot. This week-long camp takes students through a project-based challenge, culminating in a friendly competition with peers where students can put their creations to the test. As an introductory camp, it is perfect for students with little to no experience.

## **Intermediate Robotics Camps:**
### Session 3: July 13-17, 9 AM - 3 PM 
### Cost: $250
### The Intermediate camp is designed to support students with some robotics experience. Students are given less direct guidance and more freedom to experiment with the design, building, and programming of their robot.

### *Note: Due to the uncertainty of the current pandemic, we are unable to take registrations for the summer camps at this time. However, you can place your childâ€™s name on a waiting list. As soon as we are cleared to resume normal activities, we'll start accepting registrations, beginning with those on the waiting list. Please email Creed Watts at creed.watts@wjusd.org with any questions.*
