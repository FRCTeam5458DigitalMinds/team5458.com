## Note: Due to the continued issues surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19, all summer camps have been canceled.

### Every summer, Digital Minds holds robotics summer camps to give students entering grades 4-8 hands-on experience in STEM through project-based challenges with their peers. We hold introductory and intermediate sessions to cater to students with different levels of experience.

## **Introductory Robotics Camps:**
### Session 1: June 22-26, 9 AM - 3 PM
### Session 2: July 6-10, 9 AM - 3 PM
### Cost: $250
### In this camp, students develop science, math, engineering and programming skills while designing, building, and programming a robot. This week-long camp takes students through a project-based challenge, culminating in a friendly competition with peers where students can put their creations to the test. As an introductory camp, it is perfect for students with little to no experience.

## **Intermediate Robotics Camps:**
### Session 3: July 13-17, 9 AM - 3 PM 
### Cost: $250
### The Intermediate camp is designed to support students with some robotics experience. Students are given less direct guidance and more freedom to experiment with the design, building, and programming of their robot.
