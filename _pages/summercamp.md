## *Note: Due to the continued issues surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19, all summer camps have been canceled.*

### *Note: Due to the uncertainty of the current pandemic, we are unable to take registrations for the summer camps at this time. However, you can place your childâ€™s name on a waiting list. As soon as we are cleared to resume normal activities, we'll start accepting registrations, beginning with those on the waiting list. Please email Creed Watts at creed.watts@wjusd.org with any questions.*
