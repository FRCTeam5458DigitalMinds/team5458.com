In this camp, students develop science, math, engineering and programming skills through various hands-on projects, including a culminating competition. As an introductory camp, this camp is perfect for kids with little or no robotics experience.

## Intermediate Robotics:
### Session 3: August 1 - 5, 9am – 3pm
This camp is geared towards those students who already have some robotics experience. The students will have more freedom as they design and build their more rigorous projects. Session 3 participants will also be introduced to 3D printing.
