## Communtiy Outreach 
Team 5458's journey began with a focus on serving high school students in the Woodland community. However, as we evolved, our commitment to education and outreach extended its embrace to a broader demographic. We firmly believe that robotics education should be accessible to learners of all ages, and this belief has driven us to expand our programs to younger generations. Our team is incredibly focused on giving back to our community, none of our programs, events, or presentations are at any cost toward attendees. We want to share endless opportunities that the STEM community has to offer and to encourage the next generation of innovators within our community in Woodland. 

## Women In STEM empowerment
One of our latest community outreach programs is Women in STEM Empowerment Events, or WiSE for short. These events are for kids grades from 3rd to 8th, creating a safe environment for everyone.  The events are open to all students regardless of what they identify as. We aim to help young girls and boys get involved and excited about STEM. WiSE events consist of several hands-on experiments in different areas of STEM.

## Robotics Summer Camps
Our annual robotics summer camp is available for grades 4th through 8th. The three-week-long camp, broken into 3 sessions, takes students through a project-based challenge, in which students learn how to design, build, and program a robot. The program features a fun and interactive competition with peers, where students get to put their creations to the test.

## Other Activities:
We have participated in other community events like the local Christmas parade and local fair. Many students were enthusiastic about the design and engineering process behind fabricating such a robust robot. Through these events we were able to reach out to thousands of community members. 
We have also taken part in events such as Back to School nights and Club Rushes to generate interest and exhibit our seasonal robot. Students learned the importance of the team in our community and how they can get involved.
